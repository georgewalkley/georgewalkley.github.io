title:  "Week 15: Milestones, New Project and Happy Hour"
---

Two big milestones this week: I finished the strategy project that I’ve been working on for the last three months for publishing services company <a href="https://www.wearewhitefox.com">Whitefox</a>, and the first HarperCollins titles went live on <a href="https://www.xigxag.co.uk">Xigxag</a>.

I’m starting a new long-term side project next week: a DBA at Bristol Business School, so spent a lot of the week on the phone with their admissions team chasing up registration information.

On Wednesday <a href="https://www.stationers.org">the Stationers Company</a> organised a Zoom happy hour for its publishing membership, chaired by Oliver Gadsby. It was a good mix of familiar and new faces, and interesting to hear different perspectives on publishing in lockdown from Stationers around the world, including a strong US contingent.
