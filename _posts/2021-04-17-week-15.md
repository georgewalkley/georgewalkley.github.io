title:  "Week 15: Milestones, New Project and Happy Hour"
---

Brief weeknotes as it's been really busy. Two big milestones this week: I finished the strategy project that I’ve been working on for the last three months for publishing services company <a href="https://www.wearewhitefox.com">Whitefox</a>, and the first HarperCollins titles went live on <a href="https://www.xigxag.co.uk">Xigxag</a>.

I’m starting a new long-term side project next week: I've been accepted on <a href="https://courses.uwe.ac.uk/N12T4/doctor-of-business-administration">the DBA programme at Bristol Business School</a>, so spent a lot of the week on the phone with their admissions team chasing up registration information and making other arrangements. There's the usual apprehension about starting something completely new, let alone what will be a five year thing part-time. But I hope there will be a strong overlap between academic research and my professional projects.

On Wednesday <a href="https://www.stationers.org">the Stationers Company</a> organised a Zoom happy hour for its publishing membership, chaired by Oliver Gadsby. It was a good mix of familiar and new faces, and interesting to hear different perspectives on publishing in lockdown from Stationers around the world, including a strong US contingent.
