title:  "Week 9: Busy, Fibre"
---

This was one of the busiest weeks in recent memory: delivering the strategy workshop referred to in previous notes; progress on two commercial agreements for <a href="https://www.xigxag.co.uk">Xigxag</a>; a couple of calls for a new client; a follow up call with a previous client; two applications submitted for potential future projects; a mentoring session for <a href="https://www.stationers.org/education-and-charity/introduction-to-the-stationers-foundation">the Stationers Foundation</a>; and the normal round of homeschooling support. 

Having struggled with bandwidth issues since homeschooling started, Thursday was a red letter day as Openreach completed our Fibre to the Premises installation. Our broadband speed improved by a factor of fifteen - just in time for the girls to return to school and the household contention ratio to drop. But itâ€™s great to have it for the longer term. <a href="https://www.openreach.com/Salisbury">Salisbury is the first city in the UK to have complete FTTP coverage</a>, and as part of the current vogue for 'levelling up' and 'building back better', good connectivity feels like such a fundamental step for the UK.  

Next week is looking a lot quieter, and the girls will be back at school. I suspect it is going to feel very strange.
