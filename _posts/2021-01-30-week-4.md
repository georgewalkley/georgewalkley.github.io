title:  "Week 4: Clubhouse, Public Speaking, and Gifts"
---

I’ve done a lot of public speaking over the years: book fairs, conferences, corporate events, podcasts and radio. This week I did a live event on <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com">Clubhouse</a> for the first time: Xigxag's founder Kelli had the great idea of using the platform for a virtual book club, discussing Rory Sutherland’s book <i>Alchemy</i>. And it was... really difficult. Much more so than a Zoom call, let alone standing in front of a room full of people. When I first learned to do presentations, I was advised that a way to get over a big audience is to focus on a few people in the audience and present to them. Well, that one doesn’t fly in an audio-only medium. It really brought home how much I normally rely on non-verbal cues from an audience or fellow panel members as I speak. It felt like the longest hour of the week, but it went well, so <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/event/xovndBE1">we’re going to try another bookclub next month</a>. If you’re on Clubhouse, you can find me at my usual username, @walkley. 

The rest of the working week was mainly ongoing strategy work for a publishing client, a couple of business development conversations, and publisher discussions for Xigxag. The latest version of the Xigxag app is out, including a couple of new features: a sleep timer, and the ability to gift an audiobook to another person. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/georgewalkley_audiobooks-activity-6760610809061154816-8SLp">I wrote a LinkedIn piece about the experience of consulting for an early stage startup and getting used to the pace of feature development</a>, using those features as an example.
