title:  "Week 17: Meetings and Vaccination"
---

One of the stranger aspects of the last year has been working with people I’ve never met in person. I’ve been pleasantly surprised at how much can be done remotely and over Zoom, but this week I went into London for essential meetings and met most of the Xigxag team in person for the first time, which was really nice and highly productive.

Vaccination opened up for my age group this week, and I was lucky enough to get a first appointment in Salisbury on Tuesday. The whole process was extremely efficient, and though I had some low grade flu symptoms overnight and on Wednesday, nothing serious or unexpected.

Between meetings and other projects, I did a fair amount of reading for the DBA as I need to draft the first written deliverable over the Bank Holiday Weekend. But the most valuable progress came from meeting <a href="https://www.evocatus.co.uk">fellow consultant Ant Sharman</a> for a walk along the Kennet & Avon Canal and talking through the plan over several miles and a waterside pint.
