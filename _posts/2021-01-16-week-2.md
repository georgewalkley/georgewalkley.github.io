title:  "Week 2”

The project that I referred to completing last week was announced this week: the acquisition of literary agency <a href=“https://www.thebksagency.com”>bks</a> by cultural communications agency <a href=“https://www.midaspr.co.uk”>Midas</a>, which I had project-managed from initial discussions through negotiating and structuring the deal to executing the paperwork, working with bks agent James Spackman and Midas chairman George Lossius. 

In preparation for the announcement, and prompted by some practical issues in posting week notes last week, I decided to spend some time overhauling this website. It’s been a while since I’ve done any web development, let alone getting to grips with Jekyll again. But it was a good challenge and reminded me why I like working with websites: it demands a certain level of precision, but there’s an immediate feedback loop so one can work through issues iteratively. Implementing a basic cookie consent on the site caused a few more grey hairs—the apparently simple information on Jekyll Codex didn’t work, and I lost several frustrating hours to it until I found Coralie Collignon’s excellent walkthrough which helped me identify the dumb error I had been making. 

The other major frustration this week was connection problems, with one meeting missed and another delayed by unreliable broadband. But set against that, some good conversations with colleagues old and new, a couple of really interesting discussions with a current client about their strategy, and a sixteen day Peloton streak as of today.
