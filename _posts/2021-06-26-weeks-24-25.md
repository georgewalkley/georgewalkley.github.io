title:  "Weeks 24-25: DBA Progress and Metaphors"
---

A short double post catching up on several busy weeks, which included: my first IRL visit to Bristol Business School to catch up with one of the academic supervisors for my current DBA module; submitting the first formal outline for the DBA; working with Xigxag's founder to research potential investors and the usual round of following up with publishers; completing the analytical and modelling work referred to in previous weeks; doing a quick piece of work on the publishing market for a private equity firm; moving forward with two potential pieces of work; and cancelling two meetings as the people concerned had come down with the Delta variant. Not much time for reflection.
