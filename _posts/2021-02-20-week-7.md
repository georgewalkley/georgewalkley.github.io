title:  "Week 7: Half Term and Independent Consultants"
---

Half term this week, and a reminder that time passes strangely in lockdown: individual days seem long, but the weeks go by at speed. With many normal family activities curtailed, the main difference with a typical week was not having to compete for bandwidth with two concurrent sets of homeschooling. 

It was a busy and productive week for client work, thought not one with much specific to note here. 

In between project work, I had (by accident rather than design) conversations with four other independent consultants this week, discussing projects and exchanging ideas. Watercooler conversations with peers are definitely one of the things I miss from office life, and it's always interesting to talk to people working in adjacent areas, so I took a lot of energy from catching up with <a href="https://wwww.evocatus.co.uk">Ant</a>, <a href="https://www.oreham.co.uk">Emma</a>, <a href="https://www.pitchdoctor.co">Henry</a> and <a href="https://www.mwie.com">Matt</a>. I also had an opportunity to review a draft of <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/strategy/">a new section of Tom Critchlow's book <i>The Strategic Independent</i></a>. All the people I spoke to this week exemplify intelligence, curiosity and generosity in their willingness to talk about the business. Tom's book has all of those things, and even in its semi-complete form has been a constant source of inspiration, challenge and good ideas.

This week, I had the happy experience of driving a family member to their Covid vaccination, and at the end of the week I received a placeholder invitation for an in-person meeting a little later in the year&#8212;the first of 2021: things may well change, but small positive steps like these were welcome.
