I am a consultant specialising in media and publishing, and a doctoral researcher (DBA) at the University of the West of England. 

I worked in the book business for nearly twenty five years, initially as a bookseller and then in online content development for Ottakar's Plc. In 2005 I moved to the publishing side as a marketing manager at Time Warner Book Group (soon after rebranded to Little, Brown Book Group), and went on to hold a series of senior marketing, digital and strategy roles there and at Little, Brown's parent company Hachette UK. 

From 2014-16, I earned an MBA (with Distinction) from Cass Business School at City, University of London, researching my dissertation on critical success factors in corporate venture capital. I am also a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts and a Liveryman of the Stationers Company. 

I live in Wiltshire with my wife and daughters.
