Welcome to my website. Like my working life it reflects a range of activities and interests.

<a href="/consulting/">I run a consulting company called Outside Context</a>. We help clients in the creative, media, publishing and startup worlds with strategy, digital transformation and commercial development. (If you are organising a conference or event, <a href="/speaking/">I'm an experienced speaker on those topics</a>.)

I'm also a part-time doctoral researcher (DBA) at the University of the West of England. 

For a sense of what projects I'm working on at present, <a href="/weeknotes/">you can read my weeknotes</a>.

<a href="/george/">You can find out more about my background and experience here</a>.

To discuss any of these areas, you can find contact information in the footer below, <a href="https://www.calendly.com/outsidecontext">or book a Zoom or phone call with me here</a>.
