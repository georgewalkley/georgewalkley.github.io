Welcome to my website. I am an independent strategy consultant based in Wiltshire, UK. After nearly twenty five years in the publishing industry, including senior executive roles in strategy, digital transformation and innovation, I now work on a freelance basis for a range of clients in the creative, media and publishing sectors.

Recent projects include:
* Developing a direct-to-consumer/ecommerce strategy for a publisher
* Consulting on publishing industry trends and developments for clients including a private equity firm, publishers and startups

To explore if I can help your organisation with its own challenges, <a href="https://calendly.com/outsidecontext">please don't hesitate to arrange a meeting through Calendly</a>.
