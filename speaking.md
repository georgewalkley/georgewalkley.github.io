I am a highly experienced public speaker with over fifteen years of experience as a keynote presenter, panellist, session chair, podcast guest and media commentator. I've spoken on digital transformation, strategy, media trends and M&A in publishing at international book fairs (London, Frankfurt, Moscow, Buenos Aires), industry conferences, universities and corporate events. As a commentator I have appeared on BBC Radio and on the Economist Intelligence Unit podcast. Whatever the location or theme, I deliver a clear message tailored to the audience in question. 

Whether your next event is face to face or delivered online, please get in touch to discuss how I can contribute to it.
